\section{Readers-Writers Problem}
In the readers-writers problem there are some processes ( termed readers ) who only read 
the shared data, and never change it, and there are other processes ( termed writers ) 
who may change the data in addition to or instead of reading it. There is no limit to how 
many readers can access the data simultaneously, but when a writer accesses the data, 
it needs exclusive access.


The first readers-writers problem gives priority to readers. In this problem, if a reader 
wants access to the data, and there is not already a writer accessing it, then access is 
granted to the reader. A solution to this problem can lead to starvation of the writers, 
as there could always be more readers coming along to access the data. 
( A steady stream of readers will jump ahead of waiting writers as long as there is currently 
already another reader accessing the data, because the writer is forced to wait until the data 
is idle, which may never happen if there are enough readers. )
