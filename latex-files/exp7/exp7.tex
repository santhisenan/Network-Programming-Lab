    \section{Basic Networking Commands}
    
    \subsection{ip}
    The new and recommended alternative (to the popular ifconfig command)for examining a network configuration on Debian Linux is ip command.
    It is used to show and manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels.
    
    ip syntax:
    \begin{verbatim}
    ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    where OBJECT may be:
    \begin{verbatim}
    { link | addr | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable | tunnel |
    tuntap maddr | mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm | netns | l2tp | tcp_metrics }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    and OPTIONS may be:
    \begin{verbatim}
    { -V[ersion] | -s[tatistics] | -r[esolve] | -f[amily]
    { inet | inet6 | ipx | dnet | link } | -o[neline] }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{ping}
     Short for Packet InterNet Groper, ping is a utility used to verify whether or not a network data packet is capable of being distributed to an address without errors. The ping utility is commonly used to check for network errors.
    \begin{verbatim}
    ping [ OPTIONS ] destination
    \end{verbatim}
    
    Sample output:
    \begin{verbatim}
    $ ping google.com
    PING google.com (172.217.160.142) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from maa03s29-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.160.142): icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=14.4 ms
    64 bytes from maa03s29-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.160.142): icmp_seq=2 ttl=52 time=14.0 ms
    ^C
    --- google.com ping statistics ---
    2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1001ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 14.031/14.227/14.424/0.229 ms
    
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{traceroute}
    The traceroute command will attempt to provide a list of all the routers your connections cross when reaching out to a remote system. The output also provides some information on how long each segment of the path takes, thus giving you some notion of the quality of a connection.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    traceroute [ OPTIONS ] host
    \end{verbatim}
    
    Sample output:
    \begin{verbatim}
    $ traceroute google.com
    
    traceroute to google.com (172.217.160.142), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

    \end{verbatim}
    \begin{verbatim}
    
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{netstat}
    
    The netstat command is used to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
    
    netstat ("network statistics") is a command-line tool that displays network connections (both incoming and outgoing), routing tables, and a number of network interface (network interface controller or software-defined network interface) and network protocol statistics. It is available on Unix-like operating systems including OS X, Linux, Solaris, and BSD, and on Windows NT-based operating systems including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.
    
    It is used for finding problems in the network and to determine the amount of traffic on the network as a performance measurement.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    netstat [address_family_options] [--tcp|-t] [--udp|-u] [--raw|-w]
            [--listening|-l] [--all|-a] [--numeric|-n] [--numeric-hosts]
            [--numeric-ports] [--numeric-users] [--symbolic|-N]
            [--extend|-e[--extend|-e]] [--timers|-o] [--program|-p]
            [--verbose|-v] [--continuous|-c]
    \end{verbatim}
    
    Sample output:
    \begin{verbatim}

    ...
    \end{verbatim}
    
    
    
    
    \subsection{nslookup}
    The nslookup command is used to query Internet name servers interactively for information.
    nslookup, which stands for "name server lookup", is a useful tool for finding out information about a named domain.
    By default, nslookup will translate a domain name to an IP address (or vice versa).
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    $ nslookup google.com
    Server:		8.8.8.8
    Address:	8.8.8.8#53
    
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:	google.com
    Address: 172.217.160.142
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{whois}
    The whois protocol returns information about registered domain names, including the name servers they are configured to work with.
    While most of the information concerns the registration of the domain, it can be helpful to see that the name servers are returned correctly.
    
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    whois [domain-name]
    \end{verbatim}
    
    Sample output:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    $ whois google.com
      Domain Name: GOOGLE.COM
      Registry Domain ID: 2138514_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN
      Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.markmonitor.com

    \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{arp}
    Arp is used to translate IP addresses into Ethernet addresses.
    Root can add and delete arp entries. Deleting them can be useful if an arp entry is malformed or
     just wrong. Arp entries explicitly added by root are permanent — they can also be by proxy.
     The arp table is stored in the kernel and manipulated dynamically. Arp entries are cached and
     will time out and are deleted normally in 20 minutes.
    
     \begin{verbatim}
    arp -a : prints arp table
    arp –s <ip_address> <mac_address> [pub] to add an entry in the table
    arp –a –d to delete all the entries in the ARP table
     \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{host}
    host is used to map names to IP addresses. It is a very quick and simple utility without a lot of functions.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    $ host cet.ac.in
    cet.ac.in has address 103.10.168.12
    cet.ac.in mail is handled by 10 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
    cet.ac.in mail is handled by 1 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
    cet.ac.in mail is handled by 5 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
    cet.ac.in mail is handled by 5 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
    cet.ac.in mail is handled by 10 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \subsection{dig}
    
    The meanest dog in the pound, the domain information groper, dig for short, is the go-to program for finding DNS information. dig can grab just about anything from a DNS server including reverse lookups, A, CNAME, MX, SP, and TXT records. dig has many command line options and if you're not familiar with it you should read through it's extensive man page.
    
    
    \subsection{finger}
    finger will retrieve information about the specified user.
    You give finger a username or an email address and it will try to contact the necessary
    server and retrieve the username, office, telephone number, and other pieces of information.
    
    \subsection{telnet}
    telnet allows you to log in to a computer, just as if you were sitting at the terminal. Once your username and password are verified, you are given a shell prompt. From here, you can do anything requiring a text console. Compose email, read newsgroups, move files around, and so on. If you are running X and you telnet to another machine, you can run X programs on the remote computer and display them on yours.
