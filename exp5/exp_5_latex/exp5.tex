    \section{Readers-Writers Problem}
    In the readers-writers problem there are some processes ( termed readers ) who only read 
    the shared data, and never change it, and there are other processes ( termed writers ) 
    who may change the data in addition to or instead of reading it. There is no limit to how 
    many readers can access the data simultaneously, but when a writer accesses the data, 
    it needs exclusive access.
    
    
    The second readers-writers problem gives priority to the writers. In this problem, 
    when a writer wants access to the data it jumps to the head of the queue - All waiting readers
    are blocked, and the writer gets access to the data as soon as it becomes available. 
    In this solution the readers may be starved by a steady stream of writers.
